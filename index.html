<!-- 
	Apologies for the confusion once again. The error "Uncaught ReferenceError: THREE is not defined" occurs because the `THREE` object is not available in the global scope of the browser console.

To work around this issue, you'll need to include the Three.js library in the console before running your code. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the webpage that includes the Three.js code in a web browser.
2. Open the browser's developer tools by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by using keyboard shortcuts like F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Option+Command+I (Mac).
3. Navigate to the "Console" tab within the developer tools.
4. At the beginning of your code, add the line to import the Three.js library:

```javascript
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.131.2/build/three.min.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

5. Press Enter to execute the code and load the Three.js library into the console.
6. Now you can paste and modify your Three.js code, including the `material` variable, in the console.
7. Press Enter to execute the modified code and see the changes in the rendered scene.

By including the Three.js library in the console, you ensure that the necessary `THREE` object and its associated classes and methods are available for your code execution.
